# c20-navbot
Discord bot that will print the c20 nav

Setup
---
1. Before you are ready to run the bot, we need to setup your computer to host the bot.
2. First you will need to have NodeJS installed on your machine. You can find the latest version here https://nodejs.org/en/.
3. Next create a discord account for your bot. You can find a very easy guide on how to do this here https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token
4. Now that we have that setup, extract the zip file I have sent you and open the config.json file with a text editor. In the token property replace "YOUR TOKEN HERE" with the token for your bot that you created.
5. Your bot is now ready!
